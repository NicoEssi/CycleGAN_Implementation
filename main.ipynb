Please refer to the paper if you have any questions on how the model works, as I will only be adding comments with the assumption that the reader already has a basic understanding of the 'why'. The task will be to create domain transfer between summer and winter images from Yosemite Park. The implementation will adhere to the following structure:\n\n1. Import and Visualize the Data\n2. Set up the Data Loader\n3. Preprocess the Data\n4. Define the Discriminator Architecture\n5. Define the Generator Architecture\n6. Complete the Model\n7. Define the Loss Functions and Optimizers\n8. Train the Model\n9. Evaluate the Model\n10. Discussion","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"7dd68fee-2365-49ba-bbe7-a37bc8aa086e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
